HTML Starter Kits
==================

This is a collection of starter files that can be used to start basic HTML
projects.  Please clone this repository and then copy the file out of here, or
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository and then do
whatever you want to.

There are three variant in here so far:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.org)
- Vanilla (No extra libraries)

The links above will take you to the documentation for those two libraries.
which I highly recommend reading through if you're going to be using either of
them! It's important to know what you're getting when you include a project like
that.
